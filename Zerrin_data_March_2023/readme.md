Summary: Initial analysis performed on sample GLDS-37_rna_seq_Atha_Ler-0_sl-pool_GC_Rep5_R2-GC-C5_R1/2_trimmed.fastq). 
(Pre-trimmed data was downloaded from the OSDR).


**For taxonomy quantitation**

1.      Read QC (**FastQC**)

2.      Present QC for raw reads (**MultiQC**)

3.      Quality trimming (**Trim Galore!**)

4.      Create paired-end reads by combining single-end reads from two separate Fastq files (**FASTQ interlacer**)

5.      To identify bacteria and archaea (**MetaPhlAn**)

-Predicted taxon relative abundance omics levels

- Predicted taxon relative abundances

- Bowtie2 output

- SAM file

- BIOM file

- Predicted taxon relative abundances for KRONA

6.      Visualization (**Krona pie chart**)

For functional quantitation

7.      HuMAnN (it continues...)



**MetaPhlAn performs taxonomic assignments with NCBI.**
