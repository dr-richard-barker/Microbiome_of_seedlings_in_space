# Discussion and conclusion

**Discussion**

Microgravity environments cause plants to experience numerous physical and developmental changes due to the lack or significant reduction of gravitational forces. This situation also affects the plant microbiome, which is crucial for plant health and development. However, there's limited understanding of how microgravity impacts these microbial communities. More research is needed to understand how microgravity, plant physiology, and microbial ecology interact....

GeneLab Metadata mining reveals studies with similarities in how the experiments were conducted. These identifiers, such as GLDS-37, GLDS-38, GLDS-120, GLDS-218, GLDS-321, etc., can be found by cross-referencing for spaceflight experiments involving _Arabidopsis thaliana_ that used RNAseq to assess plant response_._&#x20;



**A. Key Methodology Similarities Across Studies**

These studies share several important methodologies and experimental conditions. Each study uses agar nutrient gels within petri dishes as the main source of moisture and nutrients for plants. The use of BRIC (Biological Research In Canisters) hardware, specifically the Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU), enables the examination of various ecotypes and genotypes on Phytagel plates. This hardware is crucial because its PDFU growth chambers offer a dark, controlled environment suitable for plant growth in space. All studies are of short duration, focusing on plant growth in the initial stages. This approach is crucial for understanding early growth dynamics. An interesting variable among the studies is the introduction of light in one (GLDS-120), allowing the study of plants undergoing photomorphogenesis under constant light, compared to those experiencing skotomorphogenesis in total darkness. This distinction is key for studying oxygen production via photosynthesis. The selection of plant ecotypes/genotypes is narrow, focusing on well-understood strains such as Col-0, WS-0, and their mutant variations. This strategy ensures consistency and facilitates comparative analysis across different studies. Lastly, there is a focused interest in examining specific plant tissuesâ€”roots, shoots, and etiolated seedlings. This priority reflects a desire to understand how environmental factors affect early stage development of roots and seedlings, which is essential for a fuller grasp of plant growth and adaptation mechanisms.

**B. Key Methodology of Differences in these OSDR Studies**

The OSDR studies exhibit significant differences, notably in the use of hardware and lighting conditions, impacting the type of tissue studied and experimental outcomes. Hardware Variations **GLDS-38, GLDS-37, and GLDS-321** utilize BRIC hardware, affecting experiment nature and plant tissue responses. **GLDS-120** employs Phytagel plates. **GLDS-218** uses the Vegetable Production System. These hardware choices influence the tissues studied and their developmental conditions. Lighting Conditions **GLDS-38** conducts experiments in total darkness. **GLDS-120** includes various lighting conditions such as continuous light and light followed by darkness. **GLDS-218** uses continuous purple light, impacting plant growth uniquely. **GLDS-37 and GLDS-321** feature both complete darkness and light/dark periods. Lighting directly affects plant physiological and developmental processes. Genetic Material and Age at Harvest. **GLDS-120** examines multiple ecotypes/genotypes, including Col-0, WS-0, and Col-0 PhyD. **GLDS-37** focuses on a range, such as Ws-2, Ler-0, Cvi-0, and Col-0.. **GLDS-321** studies Col variations like Col, Col bzip20, and Col bzip 60. **GLDS-38 and GLDS-218** concentrate on Col-0 and WS-0, respectively. The study of diverse genetic materials is vital for understanding plant response variability. Harvest age, ranging from 3 to 14 days across studies, affects the developmental stage of the plant tissues analyzed, offering insights into plant developmental responses to spaceflight conditions.

### Space lettuce microbe&#x20;

Then compare with the results from Dixit et al ., suggest that seed surface sanitization could influence the microbiome. Seed sanitization can affect the microbiome of leafy green crops and the persistence of E. coli and other microbial communities.

### Digital twin lettuce microbe&#x20;

Then compare with a digital twin lettuce microbe (using data from papers like this [Seasonal variation in lettuce microbiome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38338730/)) to summarize the variance we see in spaceflight relates to terrestrial microbiome trends.

### Conclusion

Focusing exclusively on Arabidopsis, treated under flight versus ground scenarios, and employing RNAseq as our assay methodology, our research endeavours to uncover the vital pathways involved in plant-microbe interactions and the adaptive mechanisms of the microbiome in space. The outcomes of this study are expected to furnish critical insights into optimizing agricultural practices for future space exploration missions, thereby supporting the sustainability of extraterrestrial life.
