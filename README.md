How to pul the "\_raw.fastq.gz" files from the OSDR.

I think we used our time efficiently and would ask that you review (and continue to edit) the Doc notes from yesterday which are here:&#x20;

\
We should check out the NMDC workflows?

\- I think this could be automated (or done more elegantly than my copy-paste), at least for the OSDR records. That is what #4 below is doing, right @Richard? Then do it by hand for studies not in ALDS? - If we can automate this, awesome. Otherwise, there are more identified datasets (in the OSDR alone) than us. How should we approach it?

The Google Doc of our meeting notes and the Excel sheet are in this Google Drive folder:

Please feel free to drop anything else there.&#x20;

Explore "Bacdrive" resources for new insights:

If our efforts need a different approach for documents than an open-shared Google, let me know and I will work to set it up.\
