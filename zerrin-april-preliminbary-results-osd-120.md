# Zerrin April preliminbary results OSD-120

### Executive Summary

This document presents the findings of a detailed comparative analysis between the Columbia (Col) and Wassilewskija (WS) ecotypes, focusing on OSD-120 root tip samples. Despite encountering challenges with microbial taxa detection during MetaPhlAn analysis, we have proceeded to reanalyze using alternative samples to guarantee the precision of our results.

### Data Rerun Announcement

To circumvent the issue of undetected microbial taxa in our initial trials, we have decided to rerun the analysis utilizing different samples. This measure is adopted to reinforce the validity of our findings, although similar warnings related to replicates may persist.

### Comparative Analysis Overview

For this study, the following samples were analyzed:

* GLDS-120\_rna\_seq\_Atha\_Ws\_root\_GC\_dark\_Rep3\_GSM2493773\_Day13
* GLDS-120\_rna\_seq\_Atha\_Col-0\_root\_GC\_dark\_Rep3\_GSM2493770\_Day13

However, during the MetaPhlAn analysis, a warning was issued indicating the absence of microbial taxa in both specimens.

### Presentation of Findings

The attached PowerPoint presentation comprehensively outlines our analysis results, including data on the family, genus, and species levels. It also highlights the variability observed amongst the examples within these samples.

It is our intent that these efforts will lay the groundwork for further research and provide valuable insights into the genetic variability and microbial composition of Col and WS ecotypes.



#### Microbial Detection in OSD-120 Samples: An Analytical Overview

The absence of microbial detection in the OSD-120 samples is consistent with expectations, considering the nature of the samples analyzed. The exclusive use of small root tip specimens, where endophytes predominantly occupy more mature plant tissues, such as vasculature and intercellular spaces within leaf mesophyll, rationalizes the non-detection outcome. This observation underscores the necessity of experimenting with various tissue samples to ensure comprehensive microbial identification.

**Age-Related Microbial Community Dynamics**

A comparative study involving 3-day-old Col-0 seedlings in OSD-38 and 8-day-old Col-0 seedlings in OSD-37 orchestrates a pseudo-time-series analysis. This setup offers a unique opportunity to investigate the progression and variation of microbial communities corresponding to the seedlings' developmental stages, from 3 to 12 days.

**Tissue Specificity in Microbial Composition**

The inclusion of both WS and Col-0 ecotypes in OSD-37 and OSD-120 facilitates a comparative analysis that lays the groundwork for uncovering the foundational microbial community structureâ€” a cornerstone of our research narrative. The anomalies presented by other ecotypes and genotypes, such as Ler-0, Cvi-0, and _Col-0-phyD_, offer a spectrum of diversity that enriches our discussion with nuanced explanations for observed variations.

**Source and Tissue Variation Analysis**

Variabilities between the two accessions (OSD-37 and OSD-120) might emanate from disparities in seed sources or the environments of the labs where the seeds were propagated. Additionally, tissue sampling methodologies, particularly the limited root tip sampling in OSD-120, contribute to differential microbial presence. The anticipation of a forthcoming OSDR dataset, encompassing shoot tissue linked with OSD-120 root samples, heralds the potential for a deeper tissue-specific comparative analysis.

This systematic approach towards understanding microbial dynamics across different developmental stages, tissue types, and genetic backgrounds, all within the context of plant-microbe interactions, serves as the framework for our investigation. Our endeavors not only aim to elucidate the complexities of these interactions but also to contribute significantly to the broader scientific dialogue on plant endophytic microbiomes.
